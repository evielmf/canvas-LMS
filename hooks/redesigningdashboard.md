Framer Dashboard Design for Easeboard
ðŸŽ¨ Prompt: Design a next-gen student dashboard UI for a SaaS app called "Easeboard"

About Easeboard:

A calm, smart student dashboard for Gen Z college students

Tracks assignments, classes, grades, and study reminders

Clean UI, low-stress, focus-friendly

Feels like a cross between Notion, Headspace, and Linear

âœ¨ Design Requirements:
âœ… Overall Style
Calming, minimalist, soothing

Soft pastels or muted blues/lavenders

Rounded edges (e.g., rounded-2xl), shadows, and breathing room

Use modern sans-serif fonts (Inter, Satoshi, or Nunito)

Supports dark and light mode

âœ… Layout Structure
Sidebar (left)

Icon-based vertical nav bar

Icons: Home, Assignments, Calendar, Grades, Settings

Tooltips on hover

Main Content Area (right)

Grid layout with drag-and-drop modular cards (Framerâ€™s Grid or Flex Layout)

Show:

Next Assignments

Class Schedule

Grade Progress

Study Reminder

Professor Ratings (from RateMyProfessor)

Each Widget/Card:

Card design with subtle gradients or soft shadows

Animated hover state (e.g., slight scale + glow)

Widgets can be rearranged (use Framerâ€™s drag-and-drop)

Top Header

Welcome message with user name

Date/time display

Profile icon on top-right

Bottom Extras (optional)

Study streak tracker

Motivational quote

Tiny pomodoro timer

ðŸ§  UX Focus
Feels smart: intelligently surfaces urgent tasks

Easy to glance at + fast to understand

Friendly + frictionless

ðŸ’» Responsive
Design for desktop (1440px) and mobile (375px) breakpoints

Sidebar collapses on mobile, dashboard becomes scrollable

ðŸŽ¬ Bonus:
Animate card entry using Framer Motion (fade + slide)

Include subtle theme switcher in the corner (light/dark)

The final result should feel like a premium, student-first dashboard that balances calm UX with smart features. This is for a real SaaS product, so the design must be usable, not concept art.
