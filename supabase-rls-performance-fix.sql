-- ========================================
-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION SUMMARY
-- ========================================
/*
CHANGES MADE:

1. AUTH FUNCTION OPTIMIZATION:
   - Changed auth.uid() to (select auth.uid()) in all policies
   - This prevents re-evaluation per row, improving query performance

2. POLICY CONSOLIDATION:
   - Replaced multiple CRUD policies with single "FOR ALL" policies
   - Reduces policy evaluation overhead
   - Simplifies policy management

3. DUPLICATE REMOVAL:
   - Removed overlapping policies that caused multiple evaluations
   - Fixed "multiple_permissive_policies" warnings

EXPECTED PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
   - Faster query execution on large datasets
   - Reduced CPU usage during database operations
   - Better scalability for high-volume operations

TABLES OPTIMIZED:
   - study_reminders (5 policies → 1 policy)
   - weekly_schedule (4 policies → 1 policy)  
   - canvas_tokens (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - canvas_courses_cache (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - canvas_assignments_cache (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - study_sessions (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - analytics_snapshots (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - course_health_scores (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - sync_conflicts (4 policies → 1 policy)
   - ai_conversations (2 policies → 1 policy)
   - ai_usage_stats (3 policies → 1 policy)

TOTAL: 50+ performance warnings resolved
