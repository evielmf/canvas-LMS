Final Prompt — Easeboard UI Design for a Calm & Student-Friendly Dashboard
Redesign the web app interface for Easeboard — a Canvas-integrated student dashboard for Gen Z and college students — with a calming, minimal, and aesthetically soothing design that helps students feel at ease the moment they open the site.

❗Important:
Do not change any existing functions or JavaScript logic.

All back-end and API logic (Canvas LMS, Supabase, auth, etc.) is already working.

Your job: purely visual redesign (CSS, HTML structure if needed).

🧘‍♀️ Design Goals:
Color palette: soft neutrals, pastel gradients, natural tones (e.g. soft blue, beige, sage green, lavender)

Typography: clean and spacious (e.g. Inter, Sora, or Nunito Sans)

UI: minimal cards, soft shadows, gentle transitions

No harsh contrasts or neon colors — focus on reducing cognitive load

Layout: grid-based with white space; students should feel clarity, not clutter

Pages to Style:

Landing Page

Welcome message

Soft gradient background or image that evokes calm (optional)

“Sign in with Google” CTA

Benefits of using Easeboard in soft tone

Main Dashboard

Sidebar or tabbed layout (Assignments | Grades | Calendar | Reminders)

Soft hover states, no loud animations

Calendar UI should feel like a clean journal or planner

Reminders panel should feel like a personal assistant, not an alert

Tech Stack:
TailwindCSS for styling
Next.js for frontend
Supabase backend

🧠 Make Easeboard the web equivalent of walking into a quiet study café: calm, focused, stress-free — while keeping all existing logic fully intact.
