📱 Full Mobile UX Strategy for Easeboard
✅ 1. Mobile-First Design Philosophy
Instead of adapting the desktop version, treat mobile as its own first-class citizen.

Implementation Tips:
Use Tailwind CSS responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:) to define layouts specifically for small screens

Prioritize vertical stacking of UI elements

Ensure all tap targets are large enough (minimum 44x44px)

Collapse complex filters into dropdowns or slide-overs

Replace multi-column layouts with accordion-style sections

🎯 2. Optimize Core Pages for Mobile
📊 Dashboard Page
Stack metric cards vertically

Use horizontal scroll for cards/charts (e.g., Recharts) on small screens

Reduce chart complexity (consider sparklines for quick views)

📅 Weekly Schedule
Switch to scrollable vertical timeline instead of grid view

Use swipe gestures to switch weeks

Add color-coded dots or emojis for class types (lecture, lab, online)

📚 Assignments Page
Collapse filters into a bottom sheet or floating filter icon

Use a swipeable card interface to mark assignments as "done"

Show due dates as badges (e.g., Today, Tomorrow, Overdue)

📈 Grades Page
Show grades as cards instead of a table

Let users tap to expand for more details

Display charts with minimal axes and labels on mobile

🎮 3. Floating Action Buttons (FABs)
FABs provide a clean and intuitive way to initiate key actions without cluttering the screen.

Add FABs for:
➕ Add study reminder

🔄 Trigger manual Canvas sync

✏️ Add new class to schedule

💬 Open AI study assistant (future feature)

✅ Use a fixed FAB position at bottom-right
✅ Animate in/out on scroll
✅ Optional: Use a speed dial FAB to open multiple actions

✋ 4. Touch & Gesture Support
Gestures increase speed and fluidity, especially for Gen Z users who are used to apps like Instagram, TikTok, and Notion.

Implement:
👉 Swipe left/right on assignment cards: mark complete or snooze

📆 Drag-and-drop schedule items (future)

🔄 Pull to refresh on syncable pages

👆 Long-press to open context menu (e.g., reschedule, edit)

🧭 5. Navigation & Modals
Mobile navigation should be quick, minimal, and thumb-friendly.

Recommendations:
Use a bottom tab bar for primary routes (Dashboard, Assignments, Schedule, Settings)

Replace modal overlays with slide-up bottom sheets (great for reminders, token setup)

Minimize nested routes; use slide transitions for navigation

🎨 6. Mobile Typography & Spacing
Small screens = need for legibility without feeling crowded.

Tailwind CSS Recommendations:
tsx
Copy
Edit
text-sm md:text-base
leading-tight
tracking-normal
px-4 py-2
gap-2
Use line-clamp-2 on long assignment titles

Add overflow-auto where content might overflow horizontally

🔔 7. Smart Mobile Notifications (Coming Later)
When push notifications are implemented:

Make sure tapping on one deep-links to the correct page or assignment

Allow users to mute or customize notification timing from their phone

Optimize reminder messages for short, actionable phrasing

📲 8. PWA / App-like Feel
Even before launching a native mobile app, you can make Easeboard feel native:

Suggestions:
Enable PWA support in Next.js (next-pwa)

Add app icon + splash screen

Use offline caching for previously synced data

Add "Install this app" prompt on mobile browsers
