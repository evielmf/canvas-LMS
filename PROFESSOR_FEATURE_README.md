# üéì RateMyProfessor Integration for Easeboard

This feature adds professor rating search functionality to the Easeboard student dashboard, allowing students to search for professor ratings and reviews from RateMyProfessor.com.

## ‚ú® Features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Location**: `/backend/main.py`
- **API Endpoint**: `GET /api/professor?school_name=...&professor_name=...`
- **Package**: Uses `RateMyProfessorAPI` Python package
- **CORS**: Configured for Next.js frontend

### Frontend (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui)
- **Page**: `/app/dashboard/professor/page.tsx`
- **Component**: `/components/professor/ProfessorSearch.tsx`
- **Navigation**: Added to dashboard navigation

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
cd CANVAS-LMS-

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually:
pip install fastapi uvicorn RateMyProfessorAPI python-dotenv pydantic

# Start the FastAPI server
cd backend
python main.py
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Frontend Setup

The frontend is already integrated into the Next.js dashboard:

```bash
# Start the Next.js development server
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Access the Feature

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Sign in to your Easeboard account
3. Navigate to "Professor" in the dashboard sidebar
4. Search for professors by entering:
   - School name (e.g., "University of California Berkeley")
   - Professor name (e.g., "John Smith")

## üéØ Usage Tips

### For Best Results:

- **School not found**: Try the official full name of the institution
- **Professor not found**: They might not have any ratings yet or use a different name
- **Network errors**: Ensure the FastAPI backend is running on port 8000
