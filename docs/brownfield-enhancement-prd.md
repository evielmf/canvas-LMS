# Easeboard Canvas LMS Brownfield Enhancement PRD

## Section 1: Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Analysis Source
**IDE-based fresh analysis** - Comprehensive analysis of the existing Canvas LMS Dashboard codebase

### Current Project State
**Easeboard** is a modern, production-ready Canvas LMS student dashboard that transforms the traditional Canvas experience into a calming, stress-free interface designed for Gen Z college students. The project successfully delivers:

- **Core Canvas Integration**: Complete Canvas LMS integration with secure token management, automatic data synchronization, and comprehensive API coverage
- **Student Dashboard**: Beautiful dashboard with assignment tracking, grade visualization, course management, and study tools
- **Performance Excellence**: Enhanced backend system with 90% performance improvements through database caching and background sync
- **User Experience**: Calming, minimalist design with stress-reducing interface patterns and peaceful study management

### Available Documentation Analysis
✅ **Comprehensive documentation exists:**
- Complete Tech Stack Documentation (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase)
- Detailed Source Tree/Architecture analysis
- Comprehensive API Documentation (Canvas integration endpoints)
- Performance metrics and optimization documentation
- Technical debt assessment and enhancement roadmap

### Enhancement Scope Definition

**Enhancement Type**: ✅ New Feature Addition + Major Feature Modification

**Enhancement Description**: Adding advanced analytics and AI-powered study assistance capabilities to enhance the existing dashboard with predictive insights, study pattern analysis, and intelligent recommendations while maintaining the current design philosophy and robust architecture.

**Impact Assessment**: ✅ Moderate Impact (some existing code changes required)

### Goals and Background Context

**Goals:**
• Provide predictive analytics for academic performance trends and early warning systems
• Deliver AI-powered study recommendations based on Canvas data patterns and user behavior
• Create advanced visualizations for study consistency tracking and productivity insights
• Implement intelligent course health scoring and risk assessment
• Enhance existing calm user experience with proactive, stress-reducing insights

**Background Context:**
The current Easeboard platform excels at presenting Canvas data in an organized, stress-free manner. However, students would benefit from deeper insights into their academic patterns to proactively optimize study strategies and identify potential challenges before they become critical. This enhancement builds upon the existing analytics foundation (Recharts integration, grade tracking components) to provide predictive capabilities while maintaining the project's core mission of stress reduction through better academic organization.

## Section 2: Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The existing dashboard analytics components (AnalyticsView.tsx, GradeTrendsChart.tsx) will be enhanced with predictive analytics capabilities without breaking current grade visualization functionality.

**FR2**: A new AI Study Assistant feature will analyze Canvas assignment patterns, due dates, and completion history to provide intelligent study recommendations while preserving existing assignment management workflows.

**FR3**: The system will implement a Study Consistency Heatmap (GitHub-style) showing daily study activity patterns, integrated with existing dashboard layout and design patterns.

**FR4**: Advanced Course Health Scoring will calculate 0-100 scores based on grade trends, assignment completion rates, and engagement metrics, displayed alongside existing course statistics.

**FR5**: The existing Supabase database schema will be extended with new analytics tables (study_sessions, analytics_snapshots, user_insights) while maintaining current RLS policies and data isolation.

**FR6**: Weekly Productivity Insights will be generated from Canvas data patterns and displayed in new dashboard widgets that complement existing assignment and grade cards.

**FR7**: Smart Pattern Recognition will identify study habits ("You always study late on Sundays") and present them through existing notification systems (React Hot Toast).

**FR8**: Time Allocation Breakdown analytics will visualize study time distribution across courses using existing Recharts infrastructure.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current memory usage by more than 15%, preserving the 90% performance improvement achieved by the enhanced backend system.

**NFR2**: All new analytics features must follow existing design patterns (calming colors, rounded corners, soft shadows) and maintain the stress-reducing UI philosophy.

**NFR3**: New analytics processing must integrate with existing background sync system (2-hour intervals) without impacting Canvas API rate limits or sync reliability.

**NFR4**: AI recommendations and analytics calculations must be performed client-side or through existing Supabase infrastructure to maintain current security model and data isolation.

**NFR5**: New features must be fully responsive and maintain existing mobile-first design principles with touch-friendly interactions.

**NFR6**: Analytics data retention must follow existing data privacy patterns with user-controlled data management through current settings interface.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: **Existing API Compatibility**: All current Canvas API endpoints (/api/canvas/courses, /api/canvas/assignments, /api/canvas/grades) must remain unchanged and fully functional.

**CR2**: **Database Schema Compatibility**: New analytics tables must not modify existing schema (canvas_tokens, canvas_courses_cache, canvas_assignments_cache, study_reminders, weekly_schedule) and must follow established RLS patterns.

**CR3**: **UI/UX Consistency**: New analytics components must integrate seamlessly with existing component library, use established Tailwind classes, and maintain current design system (sage/lavender color palette, soft shadows, calming aesthetics).

**CR4**: **Integration Compatibility**: Enhancement must work with existing React Query cache patterns, Supabase auth flow, background sync system, and current deployment architecture (Next.js 15 App Router, Vercel deployment).
